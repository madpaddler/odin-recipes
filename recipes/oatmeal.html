    <p>Oatmeal is a rather soggy wet mass that is consumed exclusively for the nutritionsl value that it has and no other reason.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped pecans</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, bring the water to a boil. <br> Reduce the heat to low and pour in the oats. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oats are soft and have absorbed most of the liquid, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the milk, remove from heat, cover and let stand for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the toppings and let rest for a few minutes to cool. Thin with a little more milk, if desired. Serve warm.</li>
